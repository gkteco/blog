    "# A Framework for Lazy Evaluation of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a wide range of applications, from content creation to complex problem-solving. We've seen wide application adoption for using language models as \"assistants\" for various domains, such as health care, education, content creation, and more. However, in educational contexts, these models often fall short of providing an optimal learning experience. They tend to generate complete solutions upfront, robbing students of the opportunity to engage in the step-by-step reasoning process that is crucial for deep understanding. The question that arises is, \"can we get these systems to evaluate in a 'Socratic' way?\". That is, can we get these systems to evaluate in a way that encourages the student to think step-by-step, rather than generating a complete solution upfront? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of work around having LLMs reason step-by-step (add source) but to my knowledge, there isn't an existing framework to build systems that allow the user to think step-by-step, through a problem while have the LLM assist in a pedagogical way. This is where the concept of \"lazy evaluation\" in language models comes into play, offering a more Socratic approach to AI-assisted tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post demonstrates an approach to building a framework for forcing models to evaluate in a lazy way."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind implementing lazy evaluation in language models stems from several key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pedagogical Effectiveness:* Traditional tutoring methods often involve guiding students through problems step-by-step, allowing them to think critically and make connections on their own. AI tutors should aim to replicate this approach rather than simply providing answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Resource Efficiency:* Generating complete solutions upfront is computationally expensive, especially for complex problems. A lazy evaluation approach can significantly reduce resource usage by generating only the necessary information on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Adaptability:* Students have varying levels of understanding and may require different amounts of guidance. A lazy evaluation system can essentially adapt to each student's needs, providing more or less detail as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Engagement:* By revealing information gradually, we can maintain student engagement and encourage active participation in the problem-solving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Real-world Problem Solving:* In many real-world scenarios, solutions are not immediately apparent and must be approached incrementally. Training students to think in this way prepares them for challenges beyond the classroom."

    "## A note on lazy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of lazy evaluation is well-established in programming languages, where it refers to the practice of delaying the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. By applying this principle to language models in an educational context, we can create AI tutors that guide students through problems more naturally and effectively."
